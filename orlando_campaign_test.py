Hi [DECISION_MAKER],

I noticed [COMPANY_NAME] serves the Orlando market - what an exciting time 
to be in pest control here! With the theme parks, growing residential areas, 
and booming hospitality sector, I imagine keeping your team properly trained 
for these diverse environments is both critical and expensive.

Many Orlando pest control companies are spending $4,000-6,000 annually on 
training and still struggling with:
‚úó Meeting theme park/hospitality contract requirements
‚úó Florida CEU compliance complexity
‚úó High employee turnover in the tourism market
‚úó Inconsistent service standards across different venue types

Pest Pro University has helped 500+ pest control companies (including several 
in Florida) solve this with:
‚úì CEU-approved online training (available 24/7 for shift workers)
‚úì Hospitality-specific service protocols
‚úì No contracts - perfect for seasonal staffing changes
‚úì 60% cost savings vs traditional training methods

Given Orlando's unique market demands, would you be interested in a brief 
10-minute call to see how [COMPANY_NAME] could save $2,400+ this year while 
ensuring your team exceeds client expectations at every venue?

Best regards,
[SALES_REP]
Kurt@pestprouniversity.com
(801) 440-0271

P.S. We're seeing great results with other Orlando companies serving the 
entertainment and hospitality sectors. Happy to share some specific examples."""

pest control companies in Orlando reduce training costs while meeting the

in such a dynamic area! With Disney, Universal, and all the hospitality 
growth, are you finding it challenging to keep your team trained for these

[LISTEN]

Most Orlando companies your size spend $4,000-6,000 annually on training, 
especially with Florida's CEU requirements and the specialized protocols 
needed for entertainment venues. We've helped similar companies cut that 
by 60% with our online platform.

The flexibility is perfect for Orlando's unique challenges - 24/7 access 
for shift workers, hospitality-specific modules, and no contracts so you 
can scale with seasonal demand.

Would it be worth a quick 15-minute conversation to see if this could help 
[COMPANY_NAME] handle the Orlando market more efficiently?"

[OBJECTION HANDLING]
"I understand you're busy - that's exactly why online training works so well 
in Orlando. Your techs can complete CEU requirements between service calls 
instead of sitting in classroom seminars." """
