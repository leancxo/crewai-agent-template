Hi [OWNER_NAME],

As a fellow small business owner in Orlando, I imagine you're always looking 
for ways to improve your team's skills without breaking the bank.

Running a pest control company with [COMPANY_SIZE] employees means every 
dollar counts. Many small Orlando pest control businesses spend $2,400-4,800 
annually on training and still struggle with:

‚úó Expensive in-person seminars that take your team off the job
‚úó One-size-fits-all training that doesn't fit small operations  
‚úó Long-term contracts that lock you into commitments
‚úó Per-person pricing that gets expensive as you grow

Pest Pro University was designed with small businesses like [COMPANY_NAME] in mind:

‚úì Online training - no lost work time for seminars
‚úì One low price covers your entire team (even as you grow!)
‚úì No contracts - cancel anytime if it's not working
‚úì Small business-friendly pricing starting at just $299/month
‚úì CEU-approved training that keeps you compliant

Many small Orlando companies save $1,200-2,400 per year while actually 
improving their training quality. 

Would you be interested in a quick 10-minute call to see how this could 
work for [COMPANY_NAME]? I can show you exactly how other small Orlando 
pest control companies are using this to compete with the big guys.

Best regards,
[SALES_REP]
Kurt@pestprouniversity.com
(801) 440-0271

P.S. As a small business owner, you'll appreciate our "no contracts" 
policy. Try it risk-free and see the results for yourself."""

    return """"Hi [OWNER_NAME], this is [NAME] from Pest Pro University. I help 
small pest control companies in Orlando compete with the big players by 
providing professional training at small business prices.

I see [COMPANY_NAME] is a [SIZE] person operation - congratulations on 
building your business! As a small business owner myself, I know training 
can be expensive and time-consuming. Are you finding it challenging to 
keep your team trained while staying profitable?

[LISTEN - Small business owners love to talk about their challenges]

Most small companies your size in Orlando spend $2,400-4,800 annually on 
training, and that's money that could be going back into growing your business.

What if I told you there's a way to get better training for your entire team 
for just $299 a month? No contracts, no per-person fees, and your guys can 
do it online between jobs instead of sitting in expensive seminars.

The best part? You can cancel anytime if it's not saving you money and 
improving your operations.

Would it be worth 15 minutes to see how other small Orlando companies are 
using this to level the playing field with the bigger competitors?

[OBJECTION HANDLING FOR SMALL COMPANIES]
"I totally understand being careful with your budget - that's exactly why 
we don't require contracts. Try it for a month and see if it saves you 
money. Most small companies save their subscription cost in the first month 
just from not having to pay for expensive seminars." """
