Subject: Cut Your Training Costs 60% - Phoenix Pest Control

Hi [DECISION_MAKER],

I noticed [COMPANY_NAME] provides excellent pest control services in Phoenix. 
With Arizona's strict CEU requirements, I imagine training compliance is a 
significant expense for your team.

Many Phoenix pest control companies are spending $3,000-5,000 annually on 
training and still struggling with:
‚úó Inconsistent training quality
‚úó Scheduling conflicts with field work  
‚úó High per-person training costs

Pest Pro University has helped 500+ pest control companies solve this with:
‚úì CEU-approved online training (available 24/7)
‚úì No contracts - cancel anytime
‚úì Unlimited users per location
‚úì 60% cost savings vs traditional training

Would you be interested in a 5-minute call to see how [COMPANY_NAME] could 
save $2,000+ this year while improving training consistency?

Best regards,
[SALES_REP]
Kurt@pestprouniversity.com
(801) 440-0271

P.S. We offer a free training consultation to assess your current costs. 
No obligation.
